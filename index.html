            College life was as good as having a working life. We were in class from 10 to 5:30 and the rest of our time was divided between completing assignments, participating in co-curricular activities and socialising. Ours was a campus of close-knit students who had each other’s backs through good times and bad. My classmates and my seniors had my back on tough assignments, peer problems and just about everything else. My college had some of the finest festivals that were fun to both organise and participate in.

While my social and cocurricular life was thriving, my education was sadly not at par. Some of our professors were not very good at conversing in English, and the lectures were often delivered in a casual mix of Bengali and English. There was absolutely no focus on developing soft skills, a pattern that prevails in engineering institutes across India even today. The results? A bunch of knowledgeable engineering graduates who lack the soft skills to express their talents.

I have no regrets about the years I spent in engineering school. I was given the opportunity to learn, and I was able to pursue my interests through co-curricular activities. As a result, I graduated as a self-sufficient, culturally and socially endowed individual with a good understanding of construction engineering. My interests, on the other hand, remained unfulfilled. A part of me wished to learn more about marketing, media, business management, and advertising, but that was not included in my engineering programme.
