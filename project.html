                <p>
                    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre
                    of
                    which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
                    three stumps
                    The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread
                    globally
                    with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of
                    the
                    19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over
                    100
                    members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches.

                    Instagram, LLC[6][a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American
                    company Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be
                    organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location — via geographical tagging. Posts can be
                    shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and
                    locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a
                    personal feed.[8]
                    Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1)
                    aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this
                    restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability
                    to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main
                    competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post
                    accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people
                    daily.[8]
